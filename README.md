# **Alzheimer Classification Model üß†üìä**  

## **Overview**  
This project builds an **Alzheimer Classification Model** to predict whether a patient has Alzheimer's disease based on medical data. The goal is to help healthcare professionals in early diagnosis and improve patient care.  

The following classification algorithms are used in this model:  
- **Logistic Regression**  
- **Decision Tree Classifier**  
- **Random Forest Classifier**  
- **XGBoost Classifier**  
- **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) Classifier**  
- **Support Vector Machine (SVM) Classifier**  
- **AdaBoost Classifier**  
- **Voting Classifier**  

## **Dataset**  
The dataset used is **"alzheimers_prediction_dataset.csv"**, which contains various patient-related features such as **age, cognitive test scores, genetic markers, brain scan data, and lifestyle factors**. The dataset undergoes preprocessing to handle missing values, normalize numerical features, and encode categorical variables where necessary.  

## **Project Workflow** üöÄ  

### **1. Data Preprocessing**  
- Handling missing values and ensuring data consistency.  
- Encoding categorical variables for machine learning models.  
- Normalizing numerical data for better model performance.  

### **2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
- Understanding patterns in Alzheimer's disease progression.  
- Identifying key features affecting classification.  

### **3. Feature Engineering**  
- Selecting the most important features that impact Alzheimer's diagnosis.  
- Creating new features to improve model accuracy.  

### **4. Model Implementation**  
- Training multiple classification models to predict Alzheimer's diagnosis.  
- Comparing model performance based on evaluation metrics.  

### **5. Model Evaluation**  
The models are evaluated using the following metrics:  
- **Accuracy Score** ‚Äì Measures the percentage of correctly predicted cases.  
- **Precision Score** ‚Äì Measures the percentage of correctly predicted positive cases.  
- **Recall Score** ‚Äì Measures the percentage of actual positive cases that were correctly identified.  

## **Results & Key Insights** üîç  
- **Logistic Regression** provides a simple baseline model.  
- **Decision Tree and XGBoost capture complex decision-making patterns.**  
- **Random Forest Classifier gives the highest accuracy**, making it the best-performing model for this dataset.  
- **KNN and SVM perform well but are sensitive to data scaling.**  
- **Voting Classifier combines multiple models to enhance stability.**  

## **Technologies Used**  

- **Python**  
- **Pandas** ‚Äì Data manipulation and analysis.  
- **NumPy** ‚Äì Numerical computations.  
- **Scikit-learn** ‚Äì Machine learning algorithms.  
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn** ‚Äì Data visualization.
